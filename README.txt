All the code presented was implemented for a college work at Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro.
The objective was to benchmark the LU decomposition algorithm using the Papi library.
For the benchmark the algorithm is run multiple times through a bigger matrix each time and the throughput, time elapsed, cicles used and flops are measured for each run and stored in an output file.
